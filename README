AutoPhoto was developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.6

You require an external tool to take pictures from a camera. These pictures should 
be put in a configured folder, where AutoPhoto will detect them.

Configuration of general properties happens in the file autophoto.properties.

And now have fun already :)
